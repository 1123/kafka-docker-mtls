# docker-compose supports environment variable substitution with the ${VARIABLE-NAME} syntax.
# Environment variables can be sourced in a variety of ways.  One of those ways is through
# a well known '.env' file located in the same folder as the docker-compose.yml file.  See the Docker
# documentation for details: https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/#the-env-file
# 
# This feature is being used to parameterize some values within this file.  In this directory is also
# a .env file, which is actually a symbolic link to <examples-root>/utils/config.env.  That file
# contains values which get substituted here when docker-compose parses this file.
#
# If you'd like to view the docker-compose.yml file rendered with its environment variable substitutions
# you can execute the `docker-compose config` command.  Take note that some demos provide additional 
# environment variable values by exporting them in a script prior to running `docker-compose up`.
